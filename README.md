## Getting Started

To use this Docker application, you'll need to have Docker installed on your system. If Docker is not installed, please follow the instructions on the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install it.
First run will pull the docker image, which may take some time. Make your own image for more advanced use.

## Run using Command Line Interface

To run docker container as CLI you should share the folder with PDF to process using `-v` parameter.
In this example all Figure tags without alt text will get description of image.

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/data -w /data --rm pdfix/alt-text-vision:latest generate-alt-text -i input.pdf -o output.pdf --model /model
```

With PDFix License add these arguments.

```bash
--name ${LICENSE_NAME} --key ${LICENSE_KEY}
```

Argument `--model /model` is required in order to tell vision where model is located. Without this vision would fail to find model.

You can also generate alt text just for one image using this example:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/data -w /data --rm pdfix/alt-text-vision:latest generate-alt-text -i image.jpg -o output.txt --model /model
```

For more detailed information about the available command-line arguments, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm pdfix/alt-text-vision:latest --help
```

## Exporting Configuration for Integration

To export the configuration JSON file, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/data -w /data --rm pdfix/alt-text-vision:latest config -o config.json
```
